# Minimal RTOS-like Task Scheduler + Secure Logger

## Overview

This project implements a **bare-metal cooperative task scheduler** with integrated **secure logging** on an STM32 Nucleo-C071RB microcontroller. It mimics core RTOS functionality (task scheduling, context separation, non-blocking delays) while maintaining full control over system behavior and performanceâ€”ideal for deterministic embedded systems with high integrity requirements. This project has 2 parts: Round-robin scheduling and Priority-based scheduling (without preemption).
